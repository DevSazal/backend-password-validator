Let's clone the repository on your machine.

The application includes the following files and folders.

- `src` - Code for the application written in TypeScript, Express.js.
- `cli` - Node cli script which can be performed from terminal.
- `.env.example` - A sample of .env which can be helpful for configuration.


## Installation and Configuration

Let's move to the cloned directory with your terminal.

To install, build, and start the application for the first time, run the following commands in your shell using `makefile` (only for macOS and Linux):
